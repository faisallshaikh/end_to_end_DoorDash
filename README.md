### `Project Topic` - Delivery Duration Prediction

### Problem Statement

When a consumer places an order on DoorDash, we show the expected time of delivery. It is very important for DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience. In this exercise, we will build a model to predict the `estimated time taken for a delivery`.

Specifically : we will create a model that will predict the total delivery duration in seconds 
i.e. the time taken from 

• Start - the time consumer submits the order to

• End - When the order will be delivered to the consumer 

### `Dataset Description and its Attributes`

The attached file `historical_data.csv` contains a subset of deliveries received at DoorDash in early 2015 in a subset of the cities. Each row in this file corresponds to one unique delivery.
